# CIFAR-10 C++ Model Execution

This project demonstrates the execution of a CNN-based TensorFlow model (3 convolutional layers + 2 dense layers) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, implemented in C++. The project enables layer-by-layer execution of the model using custom C++ implementations, ensuring correctness by comparing results with the original Python Keras model.

## About

The core objectives of this project are:

1. **Model Execution**:
   - The TensorFlow model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset is executed layer-by-layer in C++.
   - Model attributes such as channels, units, weights, filters, kernel sizes, and biases are extracted from the TensorFlow model and utilized in custom C++ implementations.

2. **Logging Intermediate Outputs**:
   - Intermediate outputs, layer names, and details are logged during execution for analysis.

3. **Validation**:
   - The outputs from the custom C++ implementation are compared with the Python Keras model outputs to ensure the correctness of predictions.

## Run the Project

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArkarHema/CIFAR-10-cpp-C-.git
cd CIFAR-10-cpp-C-

```

## Create build directory

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

```

## Run CMake and executables

```bash
cmake ..
./Model.exe

```

## How to interpret the results:

- Intermediate layer outputs
  Check the data/output directory for results from each layer for the tested image
- Dual test results
  View the Reports/results.txt file for comparisons between the unit and model test outputs and also the final predictions for the input image.

```
