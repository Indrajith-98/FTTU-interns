# Implementing the core functionality of the layers with C++.

### Problem Statement

1. Do a layer-wise dump for the model you have generated with your previous Deep-Leaming
   assignment. It can include inputs, outputs, weights, and other coefficients.
2. Create a config file (text file/JSON file./YAML file) containing the details of each of your layers (layer type, input file path, output file path, attributes, dimensions, and so on)
3. Develop a C++ application that Will read your config file and execute the kernels/Operators.
4. Implement the required utility functions like file read, file dump, and output comparison.
5. Implement a C++ version of each operator (floating point Operation) and execute them.
   (Reference), The application Should give a log file, which will have the execution details (layer name, function executed, execution time, pass/fail) of each of your layers.
6. Make Sure you use the modern functionalities Of C++ and that the entire project is tracked with a version control repository.
