------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incorrect value of dfs function because the logic is not correct.The issue is that calling dfs(i-1, j, grid) twice, 
which is incorrect and causes redundant calculations. Instead call dfs(i-1, j, grid) once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjusting max_number by subtracting 5 when it's not updated, which doesn't make logical sense. 
To track the maximum area, we should update max_number when a larger value is found else no.
