# GDB Debugging of cpp codes

The folders assignment1, assignment2, and assignment3 each contain sample code and log files. The log files in each folder provide detailed insights into the documenting errors, 
exceptions, or unexpected outputs and how they were addressed in each iteration. These logs highlight the steps taken to identify and resolve issues,
optimize performance, and improve code logic.
