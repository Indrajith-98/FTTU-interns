/*

1.Here in the first iteration the elements were  getting properly swapped with the first element going last and last element going first. 
But from the second iteration onwards we are still replacing 2nd,3rd,4th..etc  element with the last element. 
This is wrong and we have to replace the nth element from beginning of the array with the nth element from the end of the array.
ie instead of this     std::swap(s1[i], s1[n -  1]) it should be     std::swap(s1[i], s1[n - i - 1])
