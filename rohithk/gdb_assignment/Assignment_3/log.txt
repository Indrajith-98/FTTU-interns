/*

Issues found:
1. The dfs call for finding all the 1's that are nearer the current element is wrong as it finds dfs(i-1,j) two times, instead of it calculating dfs(i-1,j) and dfs(i+1,j).
2. The condition for checking the max number is incorrect -> max_number = (max_number + 2 < val) ? val : max_number-5, instead the max_number = max(max_number, val) works fine.
