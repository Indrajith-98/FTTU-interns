# **G_Test Assignment**

## **Task Overview**
This task involves unit testing mathematical functions in C++ using Google Test (GTest) and generating coverage reports with gcovr. The functions (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, LCM) are tested for correct outputs and error handling, including overflow and invalid inputs. The tests verify that the functions handle exceptions properly and produce the expected results. Additionally, gcovr is used to generate coverage reports, ensuring that the tests thoroughly cover the code and highlighting any untested parts.

## **Project Folder Contents**
