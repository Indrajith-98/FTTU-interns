""sort(v1.begin()+1, v1.end());""
Skipping the first element in the sorting range (v1.begin() + 1) may cause incorrect ordering of elements. 
In cases where full sorting is required for frequency-based calculations, starting from an offset position 
leads to incomplete or incorrect processing.

The corrected form is:
""sort(v1.begin(), v1.end());""

Line 43,

""sort(v2.begin()+1, v2.end(), comparecount);""
Using v2.begin() + 1 skips sorting the first element of v2. This causes incomplete ordering, leading to 
incorrect output for a descending frequency sort.

The corrected form is:
sort(v2.begin(), v2.end(), comparecount);
