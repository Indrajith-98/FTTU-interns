Breakpoints:
Line 14: Start of the for loop in the incorrect code.

Watchpoint Variables:
s1

Errors in the Code:
In the first version of the code, the swap operation in the loop is incorrect:

std::swap(s1[i], s1[n-1]);
This always swaps the i-th element with the last element, which results in incorrect reversal of the string.

Corrected Code:
std::swap(s1[i], s1[n-i-1]);
