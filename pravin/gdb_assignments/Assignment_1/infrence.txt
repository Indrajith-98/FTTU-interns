Breakpoints:

Line 47: Start of the main function;
Line 19: sortWithFrequency;

Errors in the Code:
The first element is skipped while sorting since the code has +1 in it.
-- sort(v1.begin() + 1, v1.end()) 
This causes the input array to be partially sorted, which results in incorrect frequency calculations.

The first element is skipped while sorting since the code has +1 in it.
sort(v2.begin() + 1, v2.end(), comparecount) 
This skips the first element, leaving part of the vector unsorted.

Changes to be made in Code:
sort(v1.begin(), v1.end()); // at line 24 (Fix: sort the entire vector v1)
sort(v2.begin(), v2.end(), comparecount); // at line 43 (Fix: sort the entire vector v2)
