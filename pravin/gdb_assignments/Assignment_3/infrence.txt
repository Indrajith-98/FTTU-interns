Breakpoints:
Line 30: function dfs.
Line 36: function maxAreaOfIsland
Line 63: Start of main function

Watchpoint Variables:
val, Max_number, i , j

Issues:

In the dfs function dfs(i-1, j, grid) is called twice, which creates retundency and computes the area wrong
 
In the maxAreaOfIsland function the logic to find the max_number 
max_number = (max_number + 2 < val) ? val : max_number-5;
is completely wrong.
 

Fixeses:

Ensuring all four directions (up, down, left, right) are correctly visited without duplication
return 1 + dfs(i-1, j, grid) + dfs(i+1, j, grid) + dfs(i, j+1, grid) + dfs(i, j-1, grid); 
 
updating the logic for max_number:
max_number = (max_number  < val) ? val : max_number;  // at line 45
